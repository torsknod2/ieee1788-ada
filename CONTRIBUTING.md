# Contributing to IEEE1788-Ada

## Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to the IEEE1788-Ada library.
This project aims to provide a robust and standards-compliant implementation
of interval arithmetic that can be used in high-reliability, safety-critical
and security-sensitive applications.

## Current Development Status

The project is currently in an exploratory phase where I am learning `Ada`
through practical implementation.
While the code *is* not yet be production-ready,
the ultimate goal is to develop a library suitable for:

- High-reliability environments
- Safety-critical systems
- Security-sensitive applications

## How to Contribute

### Issues

- Issues should be reported in English
- Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/torsknod2/ieee1788-ada/issues)
- Please check existing issues before creating new ones
- Provide as much relevant information as possible

### Pull Requests

- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/torsknod2/ieee1788-ada/pulls) are welcome!
- Please link PRs to existing issues where possible
- If no relevant issue exists, please create one first
- Consider opening a draft PR early to:
  - Signal that you are working on a feature/fix
  - Get early feedback through reviews
  - Avoid duplicate work
  - Enable collaboration
- Follow existing code style and documentation practices
- Include tests for new functionality

### Security Reports

For security-related issues, please use GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/torsknod2/ieee1788-ada/security/advisories)
feature.

## Special Request for Industry Expertise

I especially welcome feedback and contributions from:

- Safety assessors
- Security auditors
- Certification experts
- Industry practitioners

While my background is primarily in automotive, I'm eager to learn from experts in:

- Aerospace
- Medical devices
- Industrial automation
- Railway systems
- Other safety/security-critical domains

Your experience with different standards, assessment processes and industry
requirements would be invaluable in making this library more broadly applicable.
